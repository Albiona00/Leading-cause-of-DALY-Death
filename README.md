# Leading-cause-of-DALY-Death
Overview
This project focuses on the analysis of the leading causes of Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALY) and death. DALY is a comprehensive metric that combines years of life lost due to premature death and years lived with disability, providing a holistic view of the health burden associated with various conditions.

Purpose
The purpose of this project is to explore and understand the major factors contributing to the global burden of disease. By identifying the leading causes of DALY and death, we aim to shed light on critical health issues, inform public health policies, and guide resource allocation for disease prevention and healthcare improvement.

Data Sources
The analysis is based on data collected from reputable health organizations, such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and other relevant sources. The dataset includes information on the prevalence, mortality rates, and DALY for various diseases and conditions.

Key Features
Data Exploration: Utilize descriptive statistics and visualizations to explore the distribution of DALY and death across different causes.

Trend Analysis: Investigate temporal trends to identify patterns and changes in the leading causes of DALY and death over time.

Regional Variations: Analyze variations in health burdens among different regions, providing insights into geographical disparities.

Risk Factors: Explore associated risk factors contributing to the leading causes of DALY and death, offering a more nuanced understanding of the determinants of health.
